        <h2>My Perception in Life</h3>
        <p>Since childhood, I always believed that life would be better as I grow up, more adventurous and easier. However, as I've grown older, I've come to understand the challenges of adulthood. I never imagined how difficult life could be with numerous problems and struggles to face daily in the real world. I've gained insights into why some people have suicidal thoughts and feel lost. Despite the challenges, I reflect on my childhood days when I could be carefree and happy. Life goes on, and we must accept its realities.</p>

        <p>The lesson that resonates with me and keeps me going is "Never Give Up. Just pray to God every time and think I am special, appreciated, and unique in my own way."</p>
